#  Junior AI Engineer Technical Test

Welcome to the **Junior AI Engineer Technical Assessment**!  
This test is designed to evaluate your practical skills in data preprocessing, model training, reasoning, and deployment awareness.

---

##  Overview

**Objective:**  
Build a simple sentiment analysis model based on customer review data, and demonstrate your understanding of the full AI workflow ‚Äî from data cleaning to evaluation and deployment planning.

---


##  Dataset

You are provided with a dataset:  
`customer_reviews.csv`

**Columns:**
- `review_id`
- `review_text`
- `rating` (1‚Äì5 stars)

---

##  Section 1: Data Preprocessing (30%)

**Tasks:**
1. Load the dataset using **Python (Pandas)**.
2. Clean the data:
   - Remove null or duplicate reviews.
   - Convert all text to lowercase.
   - Remove punctuation and special characters.
3. Create a new column `sentiment`:
   - **Positive** ‚Üí rating ‚â• 4  
   - **Neutral** ‚Üí rating = 3  
   - **Negative** ‚Üí rating ‚â§ 2

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned dataset: `cleaned_reviews.csv`
- Brief explanation of preprocessing steps in a markdown cell or text block.

---

##  Section 2: Model Building (40%)

**Tasks:**
1. Split the cleaned dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.
2. Train a simple text classification model using one of the following:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Naive Bayes
   - DistilBERT (optional for bonus points)
3. Evaluate your model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score

**Deliverables:**
- Jupyter Notebook or Python file: `sentiment_model.ipynb`
- Summary of model performance (in a markdown cell or report)

**Bonus (optional):**
Use word embeddings such as:
- TF-IDF
- Word2Vec
- Sentence-BERT

---

## üí° Section 3: Reasoning & Explainability (20%)

Answer the following questions briefly in a file named `explanation.md`:

1. What is **overfitting**, and how can you prevent it?  
2. If your model predicts **‚ÄúPositive‚Äù** for all reviews, what does that imply?  
3. How would you improve model accuracy with **limited data**?

---

##  Section 4: Deployment Thought Exercise (10%)

**Scenario:**
You need to deploy this sentiment analysis model to a mobile app that processes **1,000 reviews per minute**.

**Question:**
Describe (in 1 short paragraph) how you would design the **deployment pipeline** to ensure scalability and efficiency.

Include your answer in `explanation.md`.

##  Setup Instructions

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- Recommended libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib nltk
